This is my first activity in TryHackMe.
It has instructions to hack a website.
It also introduced me to GoBuster.
As per ChatGPT, GoBuster is a tool used in penetration testing and cybersecurity assessments for brute-forcing web directories, files, and DNS subdomains.
It works by sending numerous HTTP requests based on a wordlist to identify hidden or restricted resources on a web server.
This helps in uncovering sensitive files, directories, or subdomains that may be vulnerable to exploitation.
GoBuster is fast and efficient, written in Go language, and is commonly included in tools like Kali Linux.
Itâ€™s particularly useful during reconnaissance phases of penetration testing.
The command used in CLI is "gobuster -u http://fakebank.thm -w wordlist.txt dir".
I was able to perform a brute-attack to the website.

Then I was introduced to Security Operations Center (SOC), Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DRFI), Threat Intelligence, and Malware Analysis.
I was introduced to a SIEM tool where it has a notification on a failed login attempt.
Along the way with the activity, the IP address was the crucial information for checking its safeteness.
It was added to a list of blocked IP addresses since the tool confirmed that it's malicious.

I was also introduced with the roles in the cybersecurity field.
I am interested with the Security Analyst, Incident Responder and Malware Analyst roles.

I did the TryHackMe cyber careers quiz and found that I would make a good Incident Responder! I'm taking the right path in becoming a Chaos Control Specialist. Nice.
I took three learning pathways. These are:
